NOTE: The web-app is still largely a prototype! Many of the features are to be implemented.

To do to run:
npm install
npm start

Things you could try:
1. Click between Home, Calendar, Today tabs (Profile is to be completed)
2. Press the "Complete" button in Home
3. Scroll through feed inside "Today" tab
4. Click a day in the calendar (Isn't actually display data from that day but a prototype of how it would look like)
